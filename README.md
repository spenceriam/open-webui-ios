**Open WebUI iOS is a native application that faithfully recreates the Open WebUI experience for mobile devices, providing users with a visually identical and functionally equivalent interface to interact with both local LLM models via Ollama and cloud-based AI services.**

> [!NOTE]  
> This project is now in alpha stage with Phase 2 development complete. Core features including chat interface, model selection, conversation organization, settings, and API integrations are now implemented. The repository contains both the original Open WebUI codebase for reference and the iOS-specific implementation.

## Key Features of Open WebUI iOS ‚≠ê

- üîÑ **Ollama/OpenAI/OpenRouter Integration**: Connect to Ollama instances on your local network and seamlessly integrate with OpenAI-compatible APIs for versatile conversations, with user-provided API keys for cloud services.

- üì± **Visual Consistency with Open WebUI**: Experience the same functionality and visual design of the web version, adapted specifically for iOS devices.

- üîê **iOS-Native Security**: Secure your API keys with iOS Keychain storage and enjoy end-to-end encryption for all network communications.

- üí¨ **Advanced Chat Interface**: Enjoy multi-turn conversations with context retention, markdown/code syntax highlighting, and real-time streaming responses.

- üåê **Network Discovery**: Automatically discover Ollama instances running on your local network using Bonjour/mDNS.

- üîÑ **Model Management**: Browse, select, and manage models from both local Ollama instances and cloud providers with parameter customization.

- üîç **Conversation Management**: Organize your conversations with folders and tags, with search capabilities and export/import functionality.

- üåô **Theme Support**: Choose between light, dark, and system themes, maintaining visual consistency with the web version.

- üìä **Universal App**: Optimized layouts for both iPhone and iPad, supporting both portrait and landscape orientations.

## Technical Architecture üõ†Ô∏è

### App Architecture
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI for creating user interfaces that match Open WebUI design
- **Architecture Pattern**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Reactive Programming**: Combine framework for asynchronous event handling
- **Concurrency**: Swift concurrency (async/await) for asynchronous operations
- **Local Storage**: Core Data for conversation history and settings
- **Networking**: URLSession for API requests, WebSockets for streaming responses

### Key Components

#### Network Module
- REST API clients for different providers (Ollama, OpenAI, OpenRouter)
- WebSocket implementation for streaming responses
- Network service discovery (Bonjour/mDNS) for Ollama
- Request/response interceptors for logging and error handling

#### Storage Module
- Secure API key management with iOS Keychain
- Conversation history persistence
- User preferences storage
- Model metadata caching

#### UI Module
- Chat interface components mirroring Open WebUI design
- Settings and configuration screens
- Model selection interface
- Response rendering components with markdown support

## Security and Privacy üîí

Open WebUI iOS places a strong emphasis on security and privacy:

- API keys stored securely in iOS Keychain
- End-to-end encryption for network communications
- Local encryption of conversation history
- Option to keep conversations local-only
- No analytics or data collection without explicit consent
- Transparency about data usage and storage

## Requirements üìã

- iOS 16.0 or later
- iPhone or iPad
- Swift 5.7+
- Optional: Ollama instance on local network

## Running in Xcode üõ†

1. Execute `scripts/generate_xcode_project.sh` from the repository root. This
   uses Swift Package Manager to create `OpenWebUIiOS.xcodeproj`.
2. Open the generated project in Xcode.
3. Choose a simulator or connected device and press **Run**.
